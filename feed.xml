Podcast

A podcast is a multimedia file that is distributed by subscription (paid or unpaid) over the Internet using syndication 
feeds, for playback on mobile devices and personal computers. Like radio, it can mean both the content and the method 
of broadcast. The latter may also be termed podcasting. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster.

Though podcasters web sites may also offer direct download or streaming of their content, a podcast is distinguished from 
other digital audio formats by its ability to be downloaded automatically using software capable of reading feed formats 
such as RSS or Atom.

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1563956</link>
      <description>Friday on RadioWest we&apos;re experiencing The Passion of Sister Dottie S Dixon. Sister Dottie is the long-time alter-ego of Charles Lynn Frost. His creation is a Mormon mom from Spanish Fork with a gay son and a mission to bridge the divide between Mormons and the gay community. The play is being re-staged this month - so we&apos;re talking about the show and its ideas. To be sure this is a parody of religious culture, but there&apos;s more here than comedy.

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1563770</link>
      <description>This year marked the 50th anniversary of the exile of the Dalai Lama from Tibet. Thursday, we&apos;re rebroadcasting our conversation about the world&apos;s most charismatic and popular spiritual leader. Our guest is the journalist Mayank Chhaya who has said he was never in awe of the Dalai Lama, until he interviewed the leader, and spoke with hundreds of people connected to his story. His biography views the Dalai Lama from three distinct standpoints. As a man, a monk and a mystic. (Rebroadcast)</description>

This time, it&apos;s Ogden&apos;s own Legendary Porch Pounders. Dan Weldon and Bad Brad Wheeler will be in studio to talk about O-town&apos;s music scene and about the blues. They&apos;ll also be armed with guitar, harmonica and porchboard to get low-down and dirty.</description>

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1562480</link>
      <description>When Leslie and Andrew Cockburn started making their documentary in January of 2008, they didn&apos;t know the story would become one of the most important of our time. American Casino is about the subprime lending scandal and the wagers that Wall Street was placing on real people. It also follows homeowners who bore the brunt of the collapse - from foreclosure to bankruptcy to homelessness. American Casino is being screened in Utah next week, and Tuesday, the filmmakers join us to talk about it.</description>

      <description>You&apos;ve probably heard stories of people standing in line for an amazing sale or fights breaking out over a bargain table. Chances are - you may have gone to some great lengths for a rock-bottom price yourself. &quot;Cheap&quot; has become part of the American way, but journalist Ellen Ruppel Shell says it comes at a cost.

      <description>Friday, we&apos;re talking about the film &quot;Shouting Fire&quot; from director Liz Garbus. The documentary explores the state of free speech in this country. Among the stories in her film is the case of Ward Churchill, who was fired as a tenured professor at the University of Colorado after he made provocative comments about the attacks on 9/11. Garbus asks questions about the limits of free speech in free society, but she also gets at the nature of fear. (Rebroadcast)</description>

      <description>Environmental photographer James Balog says that people assume geological change is something that happened in the distant past. But the truth is these processes are happening around us every day. Balog heads the Extreme Ice Survey - a project which uses time-lapse photography to capture melting glaciers around the world.

      <description>The playwright Harold Pinter was known as much for what he said in a play as for what he didn&apos;t say. His work is famous for what is now known as the &quot;Pinter Pause&quot; - directions for an actor to be silent. The Salt Lake Acting Company is currently in production of &quot;The Caretaker,&quot; Pinter&apos;s 1960 breakout play, and actor Daniel Beecher says that the trick is to embrace Pinter&apos;s careful constraints. Wednesday, we&apos;re talking about Harold Pinter and his dark, absurd world.</description>

It&apos;s about his life from Italy to New York to Utah, but also about words and sounds as only Caldiero can express them.

      <description>In the world of investigative reporting, the goal is to seek out the truth of a story - to set the record straight. But in the new media landscape where newspapers are folding and journalists are being laid off - who&apos;s willing to do that hard work for free? In the new Atlantic Monthly, correspondent Mark Bowden says it&apos;s increasingly being done by political operatives and ideologues.

      <itunes:summary>In the world of investigative reporting, the goal is to seek out the truth of a story - to set the record straight. But in the new media landscape where newspapers are folding and journalists are being laid off - who&apos;s willing to do that hard work for free? In the new Atlantic Monthly, correspondent Mark Bowden says it&apos;s increasingly being done by political operatives and ideologues. Bowden joins Doug to talk about their &quot;post-journalistic&quot; approach, and how it&apos;s shaping the national debate.</itunes:summary>

      <description>You know Peter Sagal as host of Wait, Wait ... Don&apos;t Tell Me, but would you have recognized him in a gambling hall or a strip club? Well, if you&apos;re about to protest that you wouldn&apos;t actually go to strip club - never fear: the Harvard-educated NPR host has written a book to take you there. It&apos;s called &lt;i&gt;The Book of Vice,&lt;/i&gt; and Sagal joins Doug to share what he learned about sinful behavior and the places it&apos;s practiced. (Rebroadcast)</description>

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1557984</link>
      <description>Erin McKean says that she likes that &quot;bad English&quot; exists. That might surprise when you learn she was editor-in-chief of the New Oxford American Dictionary. But McKean believes that misusages, mispronunciations and outright errors are the ingredients of a living language. She&apos;s co-founder of a new on-line dictionary project that&apos;s trying to make sense of the way we use language today. Thursday, she joins Doug to talk about words and the new ways we&apos;re using and understanding them.</description>

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1557493</link>
      <description>It&apos;s been a week since Dan Brown published his latest novel and it&apos;s already sold more than 2 million copies. It&apos;s called The Lost Symbol and it draws heavily on the imagery of Freemasonry. The writer Mitch Horowitz says Americans have been fascinated by the occult since our nation&apos;s inception, and that the 19th century movements of Masonry, Spiritualism and Transcendentalism helped shape the American character. Horowitz joins Doug to talk about it - and about his new book &quot;Occult America.&quot;</description>

Perhaps not surprisingly, the resolution to censure him played out largely along party lines.

      <description>Tuesday on RadioWest we&apos;re reconsidering the ideas of the economist John Maynard Keynes. Our guest is Keynes&apos; preeminent biographer the British scholar Robert Skidelsky. Skidelsky says that Keynes has never been more relevant. He says the current crisis has brought to a head ideas that Keynes thought about all the time: how we explain human behavior and the role of moral judgments in economics. Here&apos;s Keynes in nutshell - inescapable uncertainty about the future.</description>

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1553462</link>
      <description>In January 2006, the small, rural community of Kanab, Utah became a center of controversy over marriage. The city council passed a unanimous resolution to define a family as &quot;one man, one woman&quot; and a &quot;full quiver&quot; of children. What they weren&apos;t ready for was the onslaught of media attention and the divisions it created in town. A new documentary called Natural Family Values is screening in Salt Lake City, and Doug talks with the filmmakers about what happens when democracy and theocracy clash.</description>

      <description>When you think of Sir Isaac Newton - you probably imagine the physicist, mathematician and philosopher who changed the way man understood the physical universe. But after years of discovery, Newton moved to London and became the Warden of His Majesty&apos;s Mint. In his book, Thomas Levenson reveals another side of Isaac Newton - the genius that helped bring down a rising star of the 17th century underworld. Levenson joins Doug to talk about &quot;Newton and the Counterfeiter.&quot; (Rebroadcast)</description>

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1552627</link>
      <description>Have you ever felt guilt or fear or maybe even attraction and worried that it was written all over your face? For the psychologist Paul Ekman - it is. Ekman&apos;s career has been dedicated to studying how emotions are expressed - down to the microexpressions of a simple muscle twitch. Thursday on RadioWest, Paul Ekman joins Doug to talk about his latest book - co-authored with the Dalai Lama - on the nature and quality of our emotional lives.</description>

      <description>What does it mean to get an education? As a high school student, the writer and critic Walter Kirn saw it as a way out of rural, run-down America, a path to the big city and bigger ideas. But life at Princeton wasn&apos;t quite what he had expected. Instead of a bastion of higher learning - it was just another set of academic hoops and competing for competition&apos;s sake. Wednesday, Kirn joins Doug to talk about his harrowing journey through American academia.</description>

It was the one of the deadliest climbing seasons on the mountain, and when Hall collapsed shortly after summiting, he was pronounced dead and left behind.

      <description>In his groundbreaking book The Omnivore&apos;s Dilemma, the writer Michael Pollan began an important conversation about food. His latest book continues his critique of the food industry, but this time he also takes on nutritional science, which he says has created nothing but anxiety and confusion about even the most basic question of food and health. Michael Pollan was in Utah last year, and he joined us to explain why Americans need a whole new way to think about eating. (Rebroadcast)</description>

Representative Lynn Hemingway is drafting a bill that would push school districts to beef up the information they pass on to kids about sex. We&apos;re talking about the bill, but also about how much information young people can handle about the dicey subject.

The book has been called both fair minded and blistering. Graham says Rumsfeld is more complicated than the common image of him as a pugnacious and inflexible villain. The book is a personal drama but also an instructive tale about what happens when a man once considered the best and brightest ends up branded a failure.</description>

      <description>Media critic Bob Garfield says that &quot;the digital revolution&quot; isn&apos;t just an abstract idea. It&apos;s an actual revolution, like fire or the wheel. Those ones and zeros have changed the way we consume news and entertainment, which means the whole system - programming, marketing and commerce - has to respond. Garfield has written a book called The Chaos Scenario, but it&apos;s not just a requiem for traditional media.

      <link>http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/kuer/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;ARTICLE_ID=1546478</link>
      <description>In 1976, Time Magazine sent photographer David Burnett to cover the reggae scene in Jamaica. Reggae hadn&apos;t really hit the United States yet, and Burnett - an established photojournalist - hadn&apos;t heard of Bob Marley until a week before the trip. It turned out to be a &quot;dream assignment,&quot; and all told, Burnett captured some 200 images of the music legend. Tuesday, Doug talks to Burnett about Bob Marley as seen in his book &quot;Soul Rebel.&quot;</description>

      <description>Journalist and writer Mark Abley predicts that by 2015 half the world&apos;s population will be speaking - or at least learning - English. But as the language sweeps the globe, it&apos;s not just changing those it encounters - it&apos;s changing too. New words are being added at a &quot;break-neck&quot; rate from other languages, from hip-hop lyrics, from the blogosphere. Abley joins Doug to talk about the journey English is taking and what the future of the language sounds like. (Rebroadcast)</description>

      <description>Four months after her father had committed suicide, Amy Irvine left Salt Lake City for the high desert town of Monticello. As a wilderness activist and apostate Mormon, she was the ultimate outsider in a community of Mormon ranchers. At its heart her book &quot;Trespass&quot; is an elegy to her father, to the desert and to the connection between body and nature. (Rebroadcast)</description>

      <description>When film critic David Gilmour&apos;s son Jesse was 15 years old, he was in trouble and he hated school. David tried helping, but nothing seemed to work. That&apos;s when the two struck upon a deal: Jesse could drop out of school on one condition. He had to sit down with his father and watch three movies a week.

      <description>For much of history, those who heard voices were thought of as having a connection to the supernatural world: Socrates, Moses &amp;amp; Joan of Arc. People still hear voices today, but now it&apos;s explained as a trick of the human psyche or as a disease. After his own father struggled with voices, the journalist Daniel Smith set-out to understand the phenomenon.
