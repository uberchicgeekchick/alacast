  gPodder iPod sync support
  =========================

This file sums up the current status of iPod sync support.

Added libipodsync.py that depends on two new libraries: eyeD3 and gpod.

gPodder_iPodSync support should be OPTIONAL, and gPodder should work without 
gpod and pymad (or eyed3) installed (but disable iPod sync - related functions).

*** LIBGPOD (+PYTHON BINDINGS) ***

 Upstream source:
 http://www.gtkpod.org/libgpod.html
 
 Debian's libgpod source package currently does not build the python bindings.
 I've filed a bug report and added a patch I found on the web, but this is 
 still not fixed as of now. Here's the bug report with the attached patch:
 http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=360807

 you get the source by doing a
    "apt-get build-dep libgpod"
 and then a 
    "apt-get source libgpod"

 After successfully compiling the sources, you should have a "python2.3-gpod"
 package.


*** pymad ***

-> pymad is now preferred over eyed3, because it detects the mp3 length 
   better than eyed3 (at least for me).

Install it using:

   apt-get install python-pymad

If you don't have pymad available or if you somehow can't use it, you can 
still install eyeD3 - it will be used if gpodder doesn't find pymad.


*** eyeD3 + python bindings (ONLY IF PYMAD IS NOT AVAILABLE) ***

 This is rather simple to install:

    apt-get install python-eyed3
