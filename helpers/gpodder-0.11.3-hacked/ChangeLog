	GtkWindow to a real GtkDialog to make Escape key work and set the URL
	entry box to activate the "Add" button when Enter is pressed in it

	currect podcast is selected when removing/adding podcasts; allow to

	downloads at once (very visible speed improvement); adding podcasts
	has also been improved a bit with the new code
	* src/gpodder/services.py: Support batch mode (i.e. only notify after
	all episodes have been added to th download list); this speeds up the
	UI when multiple episodes are downloaded at once

Sat, 10 May 2008 13:38:34 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Improve feed cache update speed, thanks to the users at ITT

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: fetch() now returns an (updated, feed) tuple,
	where "updated" is a boolean value telling if the feed has been
	updated since the last run and "feed" is the feedparser feed data; fix
	a bug where the etag and the last-modified time were never used in a
	conditional download of not-changed feeds (my fault ;)
	* src/gpodder/console.py: Sync the feed cache to disk after adding a
	new podcast to the subscription list
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Pass the list of old channels to the
	load_channels() function call, so we can save some CPU cycles when the
	feed has not changed and we are allowed to re-use the old, parsed one
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Don't auto-sync the feed cache when
	getting the podcastChannel for a feed; add podcastChannel.sync_cache()
	function that saves the feed cache to disk; make it possible to pass a
	list of old channels to load_channels() and use the old channel
	objects in case the new one hasn't changed since the last run
	(see http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=179261&postcount=62)

	elements have been set up (on Desktop) and don't destroy old main
	window after re-parenting the vbox to the hildonized window (on Maemo)

	* data/maemo/gpodder.desktop: Add Portuguese translation to Maemo's

	Maemo, so the window manager on Maemo shows the correct icon when
	gPodder is running instead of the "generic" application icon

Maemo-related changes; allow custom player on Maemo (optional)

	* data/gpodder.glade: gPodder maemo preferences window should be
	modal; Add "Ask before closing gPodder" checkbox to Maemo preferences
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add option "maemo_allow_custom_player" that
	allows setting the "player" and "videoplayer" variables to a command
	that will be called, like on the Desktop version (instead of always
	opening Nokia's Media Player with all files)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Maemo-specific UI tweaks
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Only call Nokia's Mediaplayer when we are
	on Maemo and when "maemo_allow_custom_player" is set to False

	first-time users to see a list of example podcasts to subscribe to;
	dynamic main menu; code supporting the main menu changes; add code for
	sending the subscription list via e-mail; import from OPML file in
	addition to import from OPML URL; remove unneeded callbacks (wishlist,
	select all, ...); optionally set title and hide url entry in the
	gPodderOpmlLister (OPML import GUI); Add Frank Harper to list of
	contributors (initial reporter of bug #82)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Add "send_subscriptions" function that

Additional fields for the device remove episodes dialog; refactoring

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add "Podcast" and "Released" columns to the
	episode selector; hide all columns in our "delete from device" episode
	selector that have all rows set to "None"; make the first text column
	of the gPodderEpisodeSelector bigger, so the episode selector is
	easier to read when there are many columns
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Use util.format_date() for
	cute_pubdate() in podcastItem
	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Document SyncTrack a bit better, add
	needed/possible keyword arguments that are used in the UI; default
	some values to None in case they are not provided; get "released" date
	from iPod's iTunesDB and get podcast name from MP3 player's sync
	folder (if this feature has been activated)
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add format_date() function that converts a Unix
	timestamp to a good representation for a date (either Today,
	Yesterday, a weekday or the locale's appropriate representation); the
	code has been re-factored from podcastItem's cute_pubdate() function
	in gpodder.libpodcasts and is now used from there

Calculate total percentage based on byte size instead of percentage

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Make sure we save the right size of a
	currently in-progress download of an episode
	* src/gpodder/services.py: Calculate the total percentage for all
	episodes based on their file size instead of their percentage done;
	this is especially important when downloading small files mixed with
	large files; this makes the estimated download time more reliable;

Correct "Close" and "Quit" behaviour

	* data/gpodder.glade: Add a "Close" menu item to the podcasts menu and
	rename the quit item to "Quit" (from "Close) to make the interface
	more consistent and to support both Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Q
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Correct "Close" and "Quit" behaviour and make
	Close be the "minimize to tray" function when the tray icon is
	enabled; when not enabled, "Close" acts the same way as "Quit" (but is
	left visible, so the Ctrl+W shortcut also works to close gPodder);
	thanks to Harley Laue for the suggestion and initial patch

	thing, because we don't need to rely on a theme-specific header
	height compared to what we did previously - one FIXME less :)

Initial upstream support for the Maemo platform (Nokia Internet Tablets)

	* bin/gpodder: Add "--maemo/-m" option to enable running as a Maemo
	application (this is only useful on Nokia Internet Tablets or in the
	Maemo SDK environment); determine interface type and set the correct
	variables on startup (gpodder.interface)
	* data/gpodder.glade: Increase the default size of some widgets to
	better fit the screens on Maemo (it won't do any harm on the "big"
	Desktop screen
	* data/icons/26/gpodder.png: Added
	* data/icons/40/gpodder.png: Added
	* data/maemo/gpodder.desktop: Added
	* Makefile: Help2man variable; new "make mtest" target that runs
	gPodder in Maemo scratchbox (probably useless for all other things);
	update the command descriptions; don't run the "generators" target
	from the "install" target; don't run "gen_graphics" from the
	"generators" target, but make it depend on the 24-pixel logo, which
	itself depends on the 22-pixel logo; this way, all should work out
	well when trying to install on systems without ImageMagick installed;
	remove *.pyo files on "make clean"
	* setup.py: Support for build targets; use "TARGET=maemo" to enable
	Maemo-specific installation options and files
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Increase the WRITE_TO_DISK_TIMEOUT to 60
	seconds, so we don't unnecessarily stress memory cards (on ITs);
	modify default path variables on Maemo (/media/mmc2)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Maemo-specific changes; clean-up the main window
	a bit and make message and confirmation dialogs Hildon-compatible
	* src/gpodder/__init__.py: Add enums for interface types: CLI, GUI and
	MAEMO; remove the "interface_is_gui" variable and replace with
	"interface", which is now used to determine where we are running
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Use /media/mmc2/gpodder/ as configuration
	folder on Maemo; use Nokia's Media player to playback files on Maemo
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Icon name changes (Maemo-specific)
	* src/gpodder/trayicon.py: Maemo support; swap popup menu on Maemo;
	Add support for hildon banners instead of pynotify on Maemo
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Icon name changes (Maemo-specific); use new
	gpodder.interface variable in idle_add

Sat, 05 Apr 2008 21:06:14 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Make i18n help text work in the console help (gpodder --help)

	* bin/gpodder: Fix a bug that would make the localized help string of
	the CLI break; thanks to Pavel Mlcoch <pavkamlc@centrum.cz> for
	reporting this bug on the gPodder bug tracker
	(Closes: http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53)

Fri, 04 Apr 2008 09:50:35 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Use the correct multimedia-player icon for the transfer main menu item

	* data/gpodder.glade: Use the multimedia-player icon for the transfer
	to device menu item (was still gtk-network, forgot to change)

Fri, 04 Apr 2008 09:48:25 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix gPodder freeze with open notifications on quit

	* src/gpodder/trayicon.py: Fix a bug when gPodder would freeze when
	a notification bubble was still open while closing the main
	application; thanks to Jérôme Chabod for reporting this issue
	(Closes: http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55)

Fri, 04 Apr 2008 09:46:23 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Increase filename size limitation from 50 to 100 chars in MP3 player sync

	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Increase the number at which file names are cut
	down in length to 100 characters and also cut folder names to that
	length; thanks to Bernd Schlapsi for reporting this bug on the list

Sun, 30 Mar 2008 10:48:41 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Make the Quit buttons actually quit when using the tray icon

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Patch from Nick L. to make the function of all
	"Quit" buttons really quit gPodder and only make the window's "X"
	button act as "minimize to tray" button; Also, update the credits name

Sat, 29 Mar 2008 17:13:26 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Project management updates (authors, contributors and copyright)

	* AUTHORS: Removed (was outdated); content now in gui.py (AboutDialog)
	* bin/gpodder, data/po/Makefile, doc/dev/copyright_notice, 
	  doc/dev/win32/setup-win32.py, INSTALL, Makefile, README,
	  setup.py: Updated Copyright and old website URL to include 2008, the
	  gPodder team and www.gpodder.org
	* src/gpodder/*.py: Updated Copyright years
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add list of contributors from AUTHORS file and
	from the content on the website's news page (please mail me if I
	forgot to mention you as a contributor, I surely have missed a few);
	make the AboutDialog's application name "gPodder" (from gpodder) and
	add an URL hook function to the AboutDialog, so the website is opened
	in the user's default web browser

Sat, 29 Mar 2008 16:30:02 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Report errors in parsing/loading an already-added channel in the navigator

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Show the error from feedparser in the channel's
	tooltip if there has been an error loading the channel
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Make sure we can load a default title
	when using get_by_url(); save the parse_error variable for each
	channel (it defaults to None if there is no error); mark the
	description text for the channel navigator in red color if there has
	been a parser error and add the parse_error variable to the liststore
	model
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Strip whitespace before and after the string in
	remove_html_tags()

Sat, 29 Mar 2008 16:18:59 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add support for Rockbox' AudioScrobbler logfile to update played status

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add "mp3_player_use_scrobbler_log"
	configuration option (defaulting to False) which controls if we are
	going to try and find a ".scrobbler.log" file that contains
	information on which tracks have been played; for this to work, you
	also have to enable the "Updated tags after download" option
	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Support for finding the .scrobbler.log file and
	updating the played status of episodes in the MP3 player sync code
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add "find_mount_point()" function that tries to
	determine the mount point on which the given directory (or file) lies
	and returns the mount point or "/" if the directory/file resides on
	the root filesystem.

	This whole patch has been contributed by Nick <nikosapi.org> - thanks!

Sat, 29 Mar 2008 16:16:06 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Merge sv.po translation from 0.11.1 release tarball

	* data/po/sv.po: It seems like I somehow messed up the translations
	merge, so here's the correct sv.po translation file, merged from the
	0.11.1 tarball; thanks to Anders Kvist <kvistkvist@telia.com> for
	pointing that out :)

Sat, 29 Mar 2008 01:20:46 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Make sure we ignore the updated_parsed of a channel if it's None

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Only try to convert the "updated_parsed"
	field if it's not "None"
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Make sure we receive a valid 9-tuple when
	converting dates from updated_parsed; if we receive a None value or
	some value that isn't "9" in length, return None
	Thanks to Chris Arnold <carnold@electrichendrix.com> for reporting
	this bug on the gpodder-devel mailing list

Thu, 27 Mar 2008 13:10:58 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
This is trunk, so set version to 0.11.1+svn

	* bin/gpodder: Set version to 0.11.1+svn

Thu, 27 Mar 2008 12:57:56 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

	* data/po/de.po: Updated German translation

Thu, 27 Mar 2008 11:52:35 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Use cPickle for dumbshelve - it's compatible and faster

	* src/gpodder/dumbshelve.py: Improve saving of channel cache and
	metadata (and basically all that currently depends on dumbshelve) by
	using cPickle as a drop-in replacement for pickle

Thu, 27 Mar 2008 11:28:31 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix problem with pickle when there is a feed parsing exception

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: When the feedparser returns an exception, this
	will be stored as object in bozo_exception. Convert this to a string,
	so the pickle module doesn't complain; thanks to VladDrac in #python
	on FreeNode for pointing me to the right direction to fix this bug

Mon, 24 Mar 2008 10:42:19 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add "3gp" to the list of video file extensions, so we detect these files

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add the .3gp video file extension to the list
	of known video file extensions, so we can detect that these are video
	files and act accordingly (in the UI and on sync); thanks to Atte
	André Jensen for reporting this bug on the gpodder-devel mailing list

Sun, 23 Mar 2008 10:39:24 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix a bug when loading invalid image data (delete cover file then)

	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Fix a bug when gPodder is unable to load
	an invalid cover image (i.e. when dragging a linked image from the
	browser to the gPodder window, the link is sent, not the image)

Sat, 22 Mar 2008 21:08:06 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Make bluetooth device discover a bit nicer

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Improve bluetooth device discovery button by not
	destroying its design when it has been clicked and the label is
	modified

Sat, 22 Mar 2008 20:45:27 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Revert previous insanity (where I selected an awful "Transfer" toolbar icon)

	* data/gpodder.glade: I wonder why I selected "gtk-network" as the
	icon for the "Transfer" button on gPodder's toolbar. It surely is
	irritating and illogical as hell.. Hmm. Anyway - now, there is a nice
	"multimedia-player" icon which probably depicts an iPod-like device
	if you use a good icon set. This makes much more sense. Go usability!

Sat, 22 Mar 2008 20:41:54 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add "Visit website" menu items to channel and episode list; simple chan menu

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add "Visit website" menu items to the context
	menu of both the episode list and the channel navigator; also, make
	the channel context menu easier to use by replacing the old
	"Edit [Channelname]" and "Remove [Channelname]" items with stock items

Sat, 22 Mar 2008 18:41:30 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix "Podcasts not being marked as new when synced to iPod" (#70)

	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Fix bug when podcasts were not marked as new
	when synced to iPod and "on_sync_mark_played" was enabled;
	Bug URL: http://bugs.gpodder.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70
	Thanks to defrex (defrex0 gmail com) for report this bug in Bugzilla

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:21:06 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Delay loading of UserAppsReader and improve libplayers

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Only load UserAppsReader's database three
	seconds after gPodder start (because we only need it when the user
	opens the preferences dialog, and if she opens it before these three
	seconds, the UserAppsReader data is loaded on demand); because we load
	the database (and generate the model) before we display the
	preferences dialog, the preferences dialog usually comes up faster
	than before (except for the situation where it is opened right after
	gPodder startup); have only one UserAppsReader for audio/video and not
	both (would duplicate the amount of work needed to read desktop
	files); cleanup some UserAppsReader-related code in the prefs dialog
	* src/gpodder/libplayers.py: Improve the reading code and make it
	possible to support multiple mime types per-UserAppsReader (i.e. both
	audio and video types are read by a single UAR instance); clean up the
	imports for this module and do other related changes to make the code
	nicer to read and understand

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:18:51 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add option to limit the maximum number of episodes per feed

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add "max_episodes_per_feed" configuration
	option (int, defaults to 200) that determines the maximum number of
	episodes that are parsed per channel/feed; if there are more episodes,
	they are ignored. This value can be adjusted via the extended
	configuration editor if you need more episodes
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add support for the
	max_episodes_per_feed configuration option above

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:13:16 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix bug with unneeded download directory being created

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Fix bug when an unneeded download
	directory would be created on every gPodder startup

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:11:18 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Only serialize DumbShelve to disk when we have changed/deleted items in it

	* src/gpodder/dumbshelve.py: Add a "__dirty" flag to DumbShelve to
	know if we have to write the DumbShelve to the disk or if nothing has
	changed since the last write (and therefore no need to run the
	time-consuming serialization code again); this speeds up initial
	loading time and probably also speeds up other parts of the code

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:09:27 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Timestamp and benchmark functions for logger

	* src/gpodder/liblogger.py: Add support for timestamping and benchmark
	functions to liblogger, so we see the microtime since gPodder startup
	and can also use the logging module to benchmark the speed of certain
	code parts; this is helpful for our performance patches :)

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:07:48 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Performance-improving patch from Nick (nikosapi) to html entity replacement

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Merge patch from Nick (nikosapi.org) to really
	improve performance of the HTML tag stripper/entity replacement code
	by using regular expressions and some more intelligent code for
	converting numeric entities to Unicode characters

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 11:06:32 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add demo code for displaying a splash screen

	* doc/dev/splash-logo.py: Added testing code that would display a
	splash screen (transparent if compositing is enabled); we currently
	don't plan to use this code for reasons described on gpodder-devel

Thu, 20 Mar 2008 10:04:14 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Filter "None" filenames from GtkFileChooser widgets

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Make sure we don't receive a "None" filename
	from GtkFileChooser widgets when connecting to the config manager

Wed, 19 Mar 2008 18:06:58 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Change the context menu of the episode list popup menu

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Simplify, re-structure and improve the context
	menu of the episode list popup menu (right-click menu); thanks to hex
	(justin.forest gmail.com) for suggesting this change and giving
	valuable input on gpodder-devel

Wed, 19 Mar 2008 15:45:15 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Patch from Nikosapi to fix MP3 player sync progress

	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Patch from Nick (nikosapi.org) to fix MP3
	player sync problems: "Instead of displaying the proper percentage of
	the copied file in the FS-based sync dialog, gPodder would initially
	report 100% and near the end of the copy it would report percentages
	>100%."

Wed, 19 Mar 2008 15:02:10 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Various Bluetooth-related fixes

	* data/gpodder.glade: Use the "bluetooth" icon instead of the (old?)
	"stock_bluetooth" icon; in Gnome 2.22, the "bluetooth" icon is nicer,
	i.e. more Tango-ish than the "stock_bluetooth" icon
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Fix a logging error; Only show "Send to [...]
	via bluetooth"/"Send to bluetooth device" when we have already
	downloaded the episodes (won't obviously work otherwise..)
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Fix bluetooth_send_file to work with both
	bluetooth-sendto and gnome-obex-send (different command line argument
	format for both)

Sun, 16 Mar 2008 12:55:49 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Python-feedparser is a dependency, so mention it in the README

	* README: Mention python-feedparser as a dependency in the README
	file; thanks to Alain Tauch for pointing this out on the mailing list

	* data/po/*.po: Updated from messages.pot

Tue, 11 Mar 2008 18:53:25 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add option to write gtkpod extended database on sync

	* data/gpodder.glade: Add a check box for the new config option
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add ipod_write_gtkpod_extended boolean
	configuration variable that controls if we want to write iTunesDB.ext
	after synchronization (defaults to False)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Glue code for UI<->Config manager
	* src/gpodder/sync.py: Use libgpod's "gtkpod" module to write the
	extended gtkpod database (iTunesDB.ext) to the iPod after sync - this
	has to be enabled via an option

Tue, 11 Mar 2008 18:44:19 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix problem with old PyGTK versions when importing gpodder.trayicon

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Apply patch from Bill Barnard
	<bill@barnard-engineering.com>, based on a patch from Jérôme Chabod
	<jerome.chabod@ifrance.com> that makes sure we can import the tray
	icon module. If not, we disable the tray icon functionality

Mon, 10 Mar 2008 16:37:38 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add support for creating M3U playlist files in download folders

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add "create_m3u_playlists" boolean
	configuration option (default False) that controls if we want to
	generate per-channel M3U playlists in our download folders
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add context menu entry for manually updating an
	M3U playlist for the channel navigator (only visible when updating m3u
	playlists is enabled
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add update_m3u_playlist() function to
	podcastChannel and call it when removing and adding downloaded
	episodes
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add sanitize_filename() function that tries to
	encode a file name in the system's encoding, stripping all chars that
	are invalid on FAT32 and other systems (e.g. slash, etc..)

Thu, 06 Mar 2008 17:46:21 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Be less verbose, consider episodes with length<=100 to have invalid length

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Remove verbose logging for episode
	metadata (seems to work now); consider episodes with a small length
	value to have invalid length, i.e. try to find the length of the
	episode by looking at the HTTP header; thanks to Bernd
	<schlaber@gmail.com> for sending in the feed URL with which this bug
	happens (length was 1) during the gPodder workflow survey :)

Tue, 04 Mar 2008 12:15:53 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix KeyError bug in custom_selection_button_clicked (from LP)

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Fix problem with localized strings on the custom
	selection buttons, i.e. pass the label to the function directly
	instead of relying on the gtk.Button to have the label in the correct
	encoding (LP: #192918); thanks to Pavel Mlčoch for reporting this bug
	on Launchpad

Tue, 04 Mar 2008 12:05:23 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix AttributeError bug in updateTreeView (from LP)

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Make sure that we have a valid "active_channel"
	when updating the tree view (LP: #183667); thanks to red26wings for
	reporting this bug on Launchpad

Mon, 03 Mar 2008 23:06:30 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add support for changing the URL of a subscribed channel (bug #42)

	* data/gpodder.glade: Make the URL entry in the channel dialog
	editable
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add support for changing the URL of a subscribed
	channel (i.e. move from the "latest" RSS feed to the "complete" RSS
	feed, as is the case with Chaosradio podcasts, for example); ask user
	if she really wants to move; handle case where the new URL is wrong
	by reverting to old URL; Improve code for moving the download
	directory; thanks to Steve Garcia <sgarcia@bak.rr.com> for the bug
	report

Mon, 03 Mar 2008 21:14:55 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Small fix for moving downloads progress bar

	progress bar is in 0.0..1.0

Mon, 03 Mar 2008 20:53:15 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add "Go to website" buttons to episode and channel (bug #43)

	* data/gpodder.glade: Add "Go to website" buttons to episode and
	channel info dialogs
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add code to open website URL or hide the "Go to
	website" button when there is no valid website link for an episode or
	channel

Mon, 03 Mar 2008 20:37:02 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Move webbrowser code to util.open_website; fix URLs to gpodder.org

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Use new gpodder.org URLs; use
	util.open_website() instead of directly interfacing with threads and
	the "webbrowser" module
	* src/gpodder/util.py: New function open_website() that takes care of
	opening the system's default web browser and opening the specified URL

Sun, 02 Mar 2008 14:20:56 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Make "gl" a global-accessible object in libgpodder

	* doc/dev/gdfs/gdfs-check.py: Adapt to new structure of gPodderLib
	* src/gpodder/*.py: Use "gl" instead of all incarnations of
	"gPodderLib()" or "libgpodder.gPodderLib()", and weed out all "gl =
	gPodderLib() lines, because it makes the code look unnecessarily
	bloated ;)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Make "gl" a global instance of the
	gPodderLib() object, and rename gPodderLibClass to gPodderLib and do
	some more cleaning-up

Sun, 02 Mar 2008 14:03:40 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Move gPodderLib().open_folder to util.gui_open

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Use util.gui_open instead of gl.open_folder
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Remove open_folder (move to gpodder.util)
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add gui_open function that uses xdg_open to
	open files and folders with their default application in the GUI

Sun, 02 Mar 2008 13:52:42 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Pickle-based storage method (dumbshelve); HTTP HEAD requests; buggy feed fixes

	* src/gpodder/dumbshelve.py: Added (replacement for "shelve" using
	pickle)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Rename *.db files to *.pickle.db, so we
	don't clash with old-style shelve .db files
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Use dumbshelve as a replacement for
	shelve; add EpisodeURLMetainfo that keeps track of metainfo downloaded
	via HTTP HEAD requests; make getting episode length and pubDate a bit
	more intelligent by trying to find correct values via HTTP HEAD;
	improve episode sorting by falling back to episode titles when no
	pubDate has been found (or pubDate is equal); 
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add get_episode_info_from_url() function that
	tries to find out the length and pubDate of an episode by looking at
	the data from the HTTP HEAD; also support HTTP proxys via an optional
	"proxy" keyword argument

Wed, 27 Feb 2008 10:44:48 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Notify user about no new episodes when updating from tray icon

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Patch from Jérôme Chabod
	<jerome.chabod@ifrance.com> to notify the user about "no new episodes"

Use xdg-open for files that we don't know the file type of

	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: If the file we want to open/play is not

When sending via Bluetooth, always rename/copy the file

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: When sending files via Bluetooth, and the file
	converter script is not enabled, we are simply copying the file to the
	sync_filename of the episode, therefore creating a nice name. We have
	to copy the file, because neither gnome-obex-send nor bluetooth-sendto
	let us specify the destination filename when sending the file, these
	utilities always take the input filename (thanks to Chris
	<gpodder@noreply.org.uk> for the bug report)

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add support for "bluetooth-sendto" as an
	alternative to "gnome-obex-send"; initial bug report and patch by
	Leonid Ponomarev (this probably adds bluez-gnome as an optional
	dependency if you want bluetooth send support)

Make feed update display "Loading" titles, only run auto update when minimized

Modularize calls to gobject.idle_add (for non-GTK support)

	* src/gpodder/*.py: Use util.idle_add instead of gobject.idle_add
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Simplify some idle_add calls, code clean-up
	* src/gpodder/__init__.py: Add "interface_is_gui" boolean variable
	that tells us if we are running in GUI or CLI mode (this is needed for
	util.idle_add to determine if it's going to use the gobject module or
	not)
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add new function idle_add() that acts as a
	wrapper to gobject.idle_add(); this will only use gobject.idle_add if
	we are in GUI mode, and will call the callback directly when we are in
	command-line mode (because we don't have to watch out for threading
	race conditions there, compared to what GTK+ gives us)

Use os.rename to make channel list saving atomic

	* src/gpodder/opml.py: Make the saving of the channel list atomic by
	first saving it to a temporary file and then using os.rename to really
	move the file in place (this should make the channel list saving very
	stable and protect against certain bad system conditions where the
	channel list is emptied); thanks to Jens Thiele <karme@berlios.de> for
	the suggestion and pointers to improve the channel saving code

Migrate from channels.xml (from 0.9.4) to channels.opml if needed

	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Add code to check if channels.xml exists
	but channels.opml doesn't and if so, try to convert from channels.xml
	to channels.opml, so users upgrading from 0.9.4 directly will have
	their channel list automatically converted;
	thanks to Tim Michelsen for the bug report and helpful Ubuntu info

Patch the feedparser module to correctly process democracynow.org

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: Add a patch_feedparser() method that checks of
	the feedparser module correctly maps the "plain" content-type to the
	correct "text/plain" content-type and if not, replace the
	mapContentType method with a fixed one; this should make the audio
	podcast on democracynow.org working (thanks to Clark Burbidge for the
	bug report)

	report back and provide useful information for debugging this error
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Close the feed cache update dialog even when the
	user clicks on "cancel" (would have stayed there otherwise)

Merge "delete episode after sync" patch from Jérôme Chabod

	* data/gpodder.glade: Add GUI elements in preferences dialog to select
	what to do after episode sync (nothing, delete or mark played)
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add "on_sync_delete" configuration option
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Glue "on_sync_delete" config and GUI together
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: If the configuration option

	it to the iPod or MP3 player (the whole patch has been initially done
	by Jérôme Chabod <jerome.chabod@france.com> with some modifications)
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Make delete_from_disk() a bit more
	robust, so it doesn't disturb libipodsync's functionality

Remove invalid channel cover images when loading fails

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Remove the cover_file of a channel when
	it cannot be loaded (assume something went wrong when downloading the

	* src/gpodder/config.py: New boolean auto_remove_old_episodes
	configuration option that defaults to False (remove on startup)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add code to automatically remove old, unplayed
	episodes on startup if the specific configuration options have been
	set; connect config manager to GUI items for the preferences dialog
	* data/gpodder.glade: Add checkbox for automatically removing old,
	unplayed episodes from gPodder on startup and a spinbutton to set the
	amount of days after which an episode is considered "old"

Wed, 12 Dec 2007 19:44:15 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Merged episode locking patch from Paul Rudkin

Mon, 10 Dec 2007 09:42:06 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Move observer code out of DownloadStatusManager into ObservableService

	* src/gpodder/services.py: Move out all observer-related code like
	registration, unregistration and notification to a new
	ObservableService class; subclass ObservableService in
	DownloadStatusManager; this makes the observer code in
	DownloadStatusManager re-usable (will be needed for new sync code)

Mon, 10 Dec 2007 09:33:26 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Selective iPod episode clean-up; "delete older than X days"

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add episode_old_age configuration variable;
	is an integer, defaults to 7. This is the number of days after which
	an episode will be considered "old"
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: iPod cleanup is now done selectively using the
	episode selector dialog; the code has been split, because we do not
	yet have an episode selector dialog for FS-based sync; add "Downloaded
	x days ago" column to "Delete old episodes" dialog and a corresponding
	button; call the callback even when no episodes are selected in
	gPodderEpisodeSelector
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Class variables of gPodder_iPodSync
	moved to __init__ to be instance variables (this should fix a bug that
	crops up now that we can selectively delete episodes); remove_tracks()
	and clean_playlist() have been modified/added to support new episode
	selector deletion code
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Move is_played() to podcastItem from
	podcastChannel (it really belongs to the item; this makes code more
	readable in other parts of the codebase); add age_in_days(), is_old(),
	get_age_string() and age_prop to podcastItem
	* src/gpodder/util.py: New function: file_modification_datetime();
	returns a datetime.datetime instance of the MTIME (modification
	timestamp) of the filename given as parameter or None if the filename
	cannot be determined; this is used for the "old episodes" feature

Sun, 09 Dec 2007 16:45:11 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Make has_converter() a bit more intelligent in detecting extensions

	* src/gpodder/libconverter.py: Convert given extension to lowercase
	and strip a leading "." from the extension, so calling code can also
	give the second value of the os.path.splitext() result directly to
	has_converter()

Sun, 09 Dec 2007 13:20:49 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix pre-setting code for filechooser buttons; Patch by Paul Rudkin

	code; use set_current_folder() instead of set_filename()
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Fix pre-setting code for filechooser-related
	code; thanks to Paul Rudkin <paul@thegithouse.com> for the patch

Thu, 06 Dec 2007 09:37:57 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Support for itms:// links (direct links to the Apple iTunes Music Store)

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Support direct itms:// links by splitting out
	the iTunes Podcast links parsing routines. This should put us in for

	translate iTunes podcast links to the correct RSS feed URL

Thu, 06 Dec 2007 09:29:09 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Support for iTunes Podcast links (http://phobos.apple.com/...)

Sort channel list (finally ;)

	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Sort channels by lowercase title before
	returning the channel list in load_channels(); this automagically
	makes gPodder's channel list always sorted :)
	Thanks to FriedBunny <friedbunny@kulturny.com> for suggesting this and
	sending in an intial patch that led to this patch =)
	* TODO: Remove implemented item: Sort channel list

Do grayscale "pill" instead of theme-based colors (for bad themes)

	* src/gpodder/draw.py: Always draw the "pill" in semi-transparent
	black/grey shades so it will work for all GTK themes (even Ubuntu's)

Mon, 03 Dec 2007 21:35:56 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Update channel navigator when iPod/MP3 player sync has finished

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Update channel navigator when iPod sync has
	finished, so we can update the "played" status in the channel
	navigator when this status has changed after we've synced ("on sync
	mark played" option)

Mon, 03 Dec 2007 21:24:17 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add option to mark episodes as played after transfer to device

	* data/gpodder.glade: Option added to preferences dialog

	an episode as played when it gets transferred to a device
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Glue code for GUI + gpodder.config
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: On sync, mark episode as played if the
	user has selected the "on_sync_mark_played" option

	re-assign new column numbers for treeChannels' data model; add
	cell renderer for pill pixbuf and remove cell renderer for status text
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add episode_is_new() function to
	podcastChannel to check if an episode can be considered "new"; use the
	episode_is_new function in get_new_episodes; add get_episode_stats()
	after an idea from Paul Rudkin <paul@thegithouse.com>; re-factor
	channels_to_model and clean out old, unused code and columns

Make sure there is enough free disk space when saving OPML channel list

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Notify user that there's some problem saving the
	current channel list when save_channels() return False
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Pass-through the return value of
	gpodder.opml.Exporter.write so calling code knows if saving the
	channel list was successful or not
	* src/gpodder/opml.py: Check free disk space before saving OPML
	channels in Exporter.write; thanks to Jens Thiele <karme@berlios.de>
	for reporting this bug on the Debian BTS (Closes: Debian Bug #452490)

Thu, 22 Nov 2007 21:52:35 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Don't send Referer header when downloading episodes

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Some podcasts now implement an
	"anti-bandwidth-theft" code that should provide other websites from
	not linking to the episodes; as we have sent a Referer header
	containing the RSS feed URL, this causes problems; Referer header
	sending is therefore disabled now

Thu, 15 Nov 2007 11:07:42 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Check free disk space before copying files to iPod

	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Check if the iPod's filesystem has
	enough free disk space before copying files over to it, as to not
	corrupt the iTunesDB in certain situations and fail when disk is full;
	thanks to Nicolas Quienot <niqooo@gmail.com> for the bug report
	* src/gpodder/util.py: Add get_free_disk_space() function that
	calculates the free (user-available) disk space on a given path

Wed, 14 Nov 2007 21:55:18 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add informative tooltips to channel navigator

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Add tooltips to channel navigator that show a
	bigger cover image, the title, description, url and used disk space
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add save_dir_size property to
	podcastChannel that contains the disk usage of the channel's save_dir;
	this can be manually updated by calling update_save_dir_size() and
	will automatically be updated when the GUI code hooks into the
	channel; also add get_cover_pixbuf() that returns a pixbuf of the
	cover for a given size or None if there is no valid cover file

Wed, 14 Nov 2007 19:19:11 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Slipstream code (enumerate instead of simple position tracking)
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Use enumerate() to iterate over a list
	of episodes instead of keeping track of the position "by hand"

Wed, 14 Nov 2007 19:17:51 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Ignore initial window events from GtkWindow in Config

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add a flag to config manager to ignore window

	and size updates

Mon, 12 Nov 2007 20:25:39 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Improve caching for HTTP redirects and minor errors; cache clean-up

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: Cache content when it comes from a HTTP
	redirect (301, 302, 307); cache feeds even with parsing errors, so we
	can "fill" our cache and not download on every startup
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add cache clean-up code after loading
	channels; this should keep the feedcache.db file smaller for users
	that like to try out new channels (or have used gPodder for a while)

Sun, 11 Nov 2007 14:24:17 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Better file extension guessing for URLs

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Improve file_extension_from_url() by adding
	additional checks for known good extensions and recurse into the query
	string if it looks like an URL; this should fix compatibility problems
	for feeds with strange URLs; should provide more reliable guessing;
	thanks to Nicolas Quienot <niqooo@gmail.com> for the bug report

Fri, 09 Nov 2007 10:05:36 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

	function to generate the total size string in the episode selector
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Use the correct (config-usig
	format_filesize() function to generate the total size string in
	podcastItem; thanks to Pieter De Decker <pdedecker@gmail.com> for
	pointing that out
	* data/gpodder.glade: Use "Preferences" instead of "Preferences..."
	which feels a bit better in the GUI

Thu, 08 Nov 2007 21:25:19 +0100 <thp@perli.net>

The mighty episode selector dialog and some menu re-arrangements

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Move the "center_on_widget" keyword-based window
	positioning code to GladeWidget to be universally usable; update
	"Device" menu item on startup; new functions: delete_episode_list()
	and download_episode_list() that both operate on lists of episodes;
	add code for invoking gPodderEpisodeSelector for deleting old
	episodes; re-work on_itemDownloadAllNew_activate to use the episode
	selector instead of hand-crafting a message dialog text; add
	update_item_device() function that will handle the hiding, showing and
	renaming of the "Device" menu in the menubar; clean-up
	gPodderProperties with callback_finished setting (now kwarg-based);
	new, might, fancy, customizable and uber-sexy gPodderEpisodeSelector
	that will prove to be useful in some places in our codebase: it
	basically allows the user to select a subset of episodes from a given
	list in a quite sophisticated way; new "delete old episodes" menu item
	added for cleaning up gPodder's downloads
	* src/gpodder/libpodcasts.py: Add delete_from_disk() convenience
	method to podcastItem; other convenience properties and functions
	needed for the new episode selector dialog: pubdate_prop,
	get_filesize_string(), filesize_prop, get_channel_title(),
	channel_prop, get_played_string(), played_prop
	* data/gpodder.glade: new gPodderEpisode dialog; re-structuring of
	gPodder's main menu to be more usable and more compact; also added the
	Ctrl+K "Remove old episodes" menu item; also use the correct
	"multimedia-player" icon name of a not really representative icon

Support syncing to FS-based MP3 players without subfolders

	* data/gpodder.glade: Add checkbox "Create a subfolder for each
	channel" to preferences dialog and rename some widgets
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add boolean "fssync_channel_subfolders"
	option that defaults to True (create subfolder for each channel)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Hook up config option fssync_channel_subfolders
	to preferences dialog; do more intelligent widget hiding for the
	"Player" tab in the preferences dialog (only show relevant widgets)
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Only append channel name as subfolder to
	destination folder name when the "fssync_channel_subfolders" option is
	True; suggested by Paul Elliot <omahns.home@gmail.com>

Thu, 08 Nov 2007 11:28:17 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix offline cache behaviour when time is not set

	* src/gpodder/cache.py: Return cached_content in offline mode when

Process events before connecting Config to gtk windows

	* data/gpodder.glade: Remove default size for main gPodder window, as
	this is now handled by the config manager
	* src/gpodder/config.py: Process GTK events in the event queue before
	connecting to the "configure-event" signal, so we won't get two
	configure events for the window for the initial size change

Mon, 05 Nov 2007 13:51:26 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Add error reporting when download fails because of an I/O error

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Catch and handle I/O errors in
	DownloadThread and format and pass on messages to GUI code when
	required; thanks to Florian Richter <Florian_Richter@gmx.de> for
	suggesting this feature after having a full disk
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Update tree view when adding a new episode;
	add new notification() method and pass this method through to
	DownloadThread, so it can present messages to the user (i.e. errors)

Mon, 05 Nov 2007 12:54:35 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Use util.find_command in more places (mplayer detection, ...)

	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Use util.find_command to detect the
	existence of the "gnome-btdownload" command and spit out a warning log
	message when the command is not available
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Use util.find_command to check for an
	installed mplayer binary (instead of relying on os.system("which...")

Mon, 05 Nov 2007 01:12:15 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Better command detection for the converter library

	for the same purpose (cover art extraction)

Sat, 03 Nov 2007 14:14:09 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Fix format_filesize() function to be standards-conformant (unit prefixes)

	* src/gpodder/config.py: Add "use_si_units" configuration option; if
	True, the user will see SI units (MB, kB, ...); if False (the
	default); the user will see binary-prefix units (MiB, KiB, ..)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Add pass-through function

	configuration saving; fix the other code to use new config manager
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: MASSIVE code clean-up; removed lots of
	old cruft and dead code that has been lying around in libgpodder for
	some time now; remove configuration code; utilize config manager;

Limit filename on FS-based sync to 50 characters

	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Do not allow extremely long file names
	that could theoretically be generated by using data from RSS feeds;
	this is needed to make FAT-based drives work with files that would
	otherwise have file names that are too long

Wed, 31 Oct 2007 15:22:32 +0100 <thp@perli.net>
Escape RSS-provided strings in Pango markup

	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Remove unneeded lexists import and
	warning; clean-up
	* src/gpodder/libipodsync.py: Use podcastItem's sync_filename()

Limit download progress status updates to reduce CPU load

	* src/gpodder/download.py: Limit the amount of status updates the
	download threads send to the DownloadStatusManager to one per second;
	this should make gPodder less CPU-intensive with many parallel
	downloads; thanks to Wilfred van Rooijen for reporting and testing

Tue, 02 Oct 2007 17:59:29 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Update channel models (icons) after iPod synchronization

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Call update_model() on each channel after an
	iPod sync, so we can update the played state on the available episodes
	lists when played state was changed by the iPod sync

Sat, 29 Sep 2007 14:12:15 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix loading of channel metadata (load auth data and settings)

	Thanks to Nick (nikosapi) for reporting and providing a patch

Tue, 25 Sep 2007 22:02:19 +0200 <thp@perli.net>

	because it's not GUI-accessible anymore and we didn't use it anyway
	* src/gpodder/opml.py: Better local filename detection by using
	os.path.exists() instead of .startswith('/'); this is also good for
	cross-platform compatibility where parts don't usually start with a
	forward slash (i.e. Win32)

Mon, 24 Sep 2007 00:09:44 +0200 <thp@perli.net>

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Simple bugfix

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 00:32:51 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Center gPodderEpisode on treeAvailable for less mouse hopping

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: If possible, center the gPodderEpisode dialog
	window on the treeAvailable, because that makes the position of the
	opened dialog more predictable and easier to use (as if the
	gPodderEpisode dialog was "inside" the treeView from which it opened)

Fri, 21 Sep 2007 00:07:49 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Don't translate feed format string examples

	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Don't mark format string examples as

Wed, 19 Sep 2007 16:57:41 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Removed channel combobox, drag'n'drop improvements + new channel cover editor

	* data/gpodder.glade: Remove comboAvailable in gPodder (main window);
	add download+clear button in gPodderChannel, rename some items that
	are now used in code; make the channel navigator non-shrinkable (so
	it is always visible, because we don't have comboAvailable anymore)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Remove support for the channel combo box,
	also known as comboAvailable; clean-up DND code and make treeChannels
	the only DND target in the main window; remove some unnecessary
	updating of the channel list (calls to updateComboBox);
	Changes for the gPodderChannel dialog: Don't automatically download
	channel cover when dialog pops up; add "Download" and "Clear" buttons
	to the cover editor; add DND support for dropping local files or
	images from the web browser to the cover editor (for setting custom
	covers on channels with bad or no cover)
	* src/gpodder/libgpodder.py: Don't abort get_image_from_url() if the
	URL is invalid, but the image has already been downloaded (because we
	read the downloaded image in the code when it exists, without URL)

Wed, 19 Sep 2007 14:23:40 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Center feed update dialog on main window; scroll reset in chan.navigator
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Reset the current scroll position of the channel
	navigator when re-loading the channel list; this fixes an annoyance
	that Alistair Sutton <alistair.sutton@gmail.com> reported when dealing
	with a HUGE channel list (more than 50 channels); also removed the
	scroll position reset code from treeAvailable, as we already managed
	to only edit the model instead of re-loading it every time; added code
	to really center the feed update dialog on gPodder's main window

Tue, 18 Sep 2007 20:15:56 +0200 <thp@perli.net>

	gpodder.download module for carrying out downloads, remove
	wget_version() tester, as this is not needed anymore =)

	dependency and with better accuracy (progress reporting, etc..)
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Utilize new gpodder.download module instead of
	libwget
	* src/gpodder/__init__.py: Add "user_agent" variable to the gpodder

	liblocdbreader/liblocdbwriter to this module as LocalDBWriter and
	LocalDBReader; customize podcastChannel to new LocalDB code

Wed, 12 Sep 2007 23:07:23 +0200 <thp@perli.net>
Fix a bug when traversing directories with loop symlinks

	* src/gpodder/util.py: Don't dive into subdirectories that are
	symbolic links, this is to avoid a situation where looping symlinks
	result in the function dead-locking in a endless recursive loop,
	thanks to Bjørn Rasmussen <bjoernr@sensewave.com> for pointing that
	out and providing the necessary bug report to fix this issue

	determined from the string passed to format_filesize(); return "None"
	in file_type_by_extension() if the extension is an empty string

	is not called anywhere from the code (uh, how did i miss that?)

	without length or mime type; ignore episodes without enclosures (it's
	not len(enclosures) == 0, but the enclosures attribute doesn't even

	observers; add request_progress_detail() function that can be used to
	force a "progress-detail" notification to be sent out to all relevant
	observers; remove get_url_by_iter() function as it is not needed
	anymore
	* src/gpodder/gui.py: Clean-up after tepache dependency removal; new
	GladeWidget base class that subclasses SimpleGladeApp and simplifies
	class creation for our gPodder windows; add context menu to
	treeAvailable; re-work play_or_download() and make it return a list of
	boolean indicators on which actions can be performed on the selected
	items; move show_message() and show_confirmation() to GladeWidget;
	disable editing of the URL in the channel info dialog, this simplifies
	code and editing the URL doesn't make so much sense anyway (adding the
	new url and removing the old does the same and is easier, code-wise);
	add support for cancelling downloads in the available podcasts view;
	support live status view and download cancelling in the gPodderEpisode
	dialog window by hooking up to DownloadStatusManager as observer
	* src/gpodder/SimpleGladeApp.py: Customize for gPodder (remove usage
	of weakref for keyword arguments -> properties of new object)
	* bin/gpodder: We're using a experimental development version now
	* data/gpodder.glade: Add progress bar and associated buttons to
	gPodderEpisode dialog
	* MANIFEST.in: Removed gpodder.py.orig inclusion
	* Makefile: Removed support for tepache
