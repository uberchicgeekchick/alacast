Usage: uberChicGeekChicks-Podcast-Syncronizer.php [options]...
	Options:


Update options (i.e., gpodder --run):
----------------------------------------------
	--use-gpodder=gpodder_exec
					Runs gpodder_exec instead of using /usr/bin/gpodder or gpodder
						that's found in your path.

	--update				runs `gpodder --run` automatically before moving podcasts.

	--nice[=priority]			Runs gPodder with the specified priority (default: +19).

	--update=detailed			Displays the output from: `gpodder --run`.
							This is usually the URIs of your subscribed podcasts
							and any new epidodes.

	--interactive			Prompts before quiting/continuing.


Output options:
--------------------
	--quiet				This keeps any output from being output to the terminal.
					This is useful when ran as a cron job.

	--verbose			These effects how much information is displayed about what
					I'm doing.  These are mostly messages useful for debugging.

	--logging			This writes all output to this script's log file.


Symlink options:
-------------------------
	--leave-trails		Leave [GUID].trail symlinks to gPodder's GUID folder.

	--clean-trails		This just removes any symlinks that may have been created by
					previously using the`--leave-trails` option.


Syncing options:
-------------------
	--keep-original		keeps gPodders GUID based named files while making copies of all
					podcasts with easier to understand directories &filenames.

	--player[=vlc|xine]	Players have issues with different charaters
					in the path's of podcast's files.  known issues are:
					- vlc won't play files with colons(:) in their path.
					- xine won't play files with octothorps(#) in their path.
					so adding this option strips these characters from podcasts'
					sub-directory and file names.
					if --player is alone all characters that might cause problems
					are removed.  if a value for player is set than just the
					character(s) known to cause issues with that player will be
					removed.


	--help			displays this screen.


			*wink* &remember uberChicGeekChicks-Podcast-Suncronizer.php is written in PHP;
			so its super easy to customize.  & remember to share ^_~
