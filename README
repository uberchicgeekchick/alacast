Alacast is an online media browser & server. Requires PHP 5.3+, PHP-GTK, & PHP-GST.

Support for almost any format will be provided by use of libvlc, ffmpeg, or libxine.
My goal is to have Alacast work like cable / satalite provider's channel browsers.
For online media, including Audio & Video.  Focused on long form content.
