Alacast is a social media browser trying to make listening to, watching, finding, and access on-line media especially podcasts.  Alacast is designed with a focus on creating a truly accessible, fun, and intuitive user interface & experience.

Embeded scripting through PHP 5.3+, PHP-GTK, & PHP-GST.

Support for almost any format will be provided by use of gstreamer or libxine.
My goal is to have Alacast work like cable / satalite provider's channel browsers.
For online media, including Audio & Video.  Focused on long form content.
