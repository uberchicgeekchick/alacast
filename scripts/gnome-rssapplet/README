You need the following packages:
* gnome
* gnome-panel
* python
* python gtk-bindings and python gnome-bindings
* wget (to download a rss-feed from a webpage)
* mozilla (for other browsers: edit settings.py)

2.2 get it work
===============

Gnome-panel needs to know that GNOME-RSSApplet exists, thats why Bonobo
needs a file which describes each applet of GNOME. Take a look at
GNOME_RSSApplet.server and change location-attribute in tag oaf-server
to the place where GNOME-RSSApplet can be found. 

Hint: If you untar gnome-rssapplet.tar.bz2 to /tmp/gnome-rssapplet/
      you do not have to modify GNOME_RSSApplet.server

#> vi GNOME_RSSApplet.server 

Afterwards copy GNOME_RSSApplet.server to
/usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_RSSApplet.server. 

Attention: You MUST be root to do this. 

#> cp GNOME_RSSApplet.server /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_RSSApplet.server

Restart your gnome-panel:
#> killall gnome-panel

Add GNOME-RSSApplet to your gnome-panel. Right mouse-click and choose
GNOME-RSSApplet from the list of available Applications
