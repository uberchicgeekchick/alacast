Is this more nonsense? Uh, no... yeah... maybe. Heh!  If you are looking for Dunkin, or Devlin, or Gabe—this is not it. This book borders on serious. I think I was out of liquor when I wrote it—but I can't remember.

When you own a media outlet, you have a responsibility. A responsibility to safe guard the citizenry from their government. But how far do you go?

This is a story about the small town newspaper business. A look at how one professional newsman uses the fourth estate exactly how it is NOT meant to be used. When you lower journalism to high comedy, is it still journalism?

Who knows. But in this book, Hard Boiled Headline, a gang of unusual newspaper hacks accept a large cash payment to start a newspaper during election season. There's only one string attached to the cash—use the paper to unseat an entire county's crooked officials." />

It’s about relationships, memory, opportunity, and dealing with their loss - and other kinds of loss.  Forget What You Can't Remember is a spin-off novel in the same universe as Lost and Not Found (also available on Podiobooks.com) which doesn’t require you to have read that book to understand it." />

John Mark Ellis and the crew of the Sanson are sent to investigate. When they arrive, they find vast alien machines known as Clusters in orbit. Fearing the worst, they land and discover that the once overcrowded, polluted Earth has become a paradise of sorts. The problem is over half the population is dead or missing and the planet's leaders don't seem to care. As Ellis works to unravel the mystery, sudden gravitational shifts from the galaxy's center indicate something even worse is in the offing. Can Ellis save the galaxy from the heirs of the new Earth?

&quot;This is a well-crafted and thoughtful piece of science fiction.  Highly recommended.&quot;  Mark Anthony Brennan, Author, Editor and Publisher

The Checkwolf series is a collection of stories chronicling the activities of Checkwolf's third phase, from its mainstream recognition to its full integration.

Book 3 demonstrates a darker and more threatening tone than the previous two releases – which is no surprise in view of the concluding moments of Book 2.  The ability of the group to function as a team is put under a constant strain, reflecting the difficult times they are facing." />

Capricious gods, shape-changing animals, and bloodthirsty demons are as real and unpleasant as a gang of vicious bandits.  From the wilderness emerges a young, idealistic warrior with his father’s mysterious sword on his hip, a wise, sarcastic dog at his side, and a yearning in his heart to find a worthy master.  He dreams only of being samurai. Little does he suspect the agony and glory that await him when his dreams come true.

Finding a master should be easy for a warrior as skilled as Ken’ishi, but the generations-long wars for the Imperial throne have ended.  The land has settled into an uneasy peace and cast multitudes of proud, powerful warriors to the four winds.  The new peace means that these masterless warriors, ronin, often must stoop to crime and banditry to feed themselves.  Ken’ishi finds himself plagued by the hatred and mistrust of peasants and samurai alike.

When he saves a noble maiden from a pack of bandits, he and his faithful dog become enmeshed in the intrigues of samurai lords, vengeful constables, Mongol spies, and a shadowy underworld crime boss known as Green Tiger.  But Ken’ishi has a few secret weapons of his own, granted to him by his mysterious past and his magical upbringing.  If only he knew more about his mysterious past, his parents’ murder, and the sword that seems to want to talk to him. . . .

Heart of the Ronin is an action-packed historical fantasy, set against the backdrop of ancient intrigue and impending war, the first of a sweeping three-part epic filled with deadly duels and climactic battles.  Creatures of folklore and myth are as real as the katana in one’s hand.  And just as deadly.

&quot;A fusion of historical fiction and adventure fantasy, the first volume of Heermann's Ronin Trilogy is a page-turning folkloric narrative of epic proportions. In a strange, supernatural feudal Japan, 17-year-old warrior Ken'ishi, a masterless samurai with a mysterious past and a legendary sword, saves the life of Kazuko, a powerful lord's daughter. Soon he becomes entangled in a deadly web of treachery, obsession and vengeance along with a bevy of conspirators, spies, assassins and otherworldly monstrosities. Though Heermann does little to push the boundaries of the subgenre, his writing style is confident and fluid, his characters are well developed and his serpentine story line anything but predictable. Numerous tantalizingly unresolved plot threads will have readers anxiously awaiting the second installment in this gripping tale of ill-fated love, betrayal and destiny. &quot; - PUBLISHERS WEEKLY

&quot;Heart of a Ronin is a solid, likeable adventure story, sure to please fans of Japanese culture, and fantasy readers alike.&quot; - ADVENTURES IN SCI-FI PUBLISHING" />

Those of mixed blood, however, are the victims of bigotry and scorned as inferior in Soldaran society.

Seventeen year old Jelena, of human and elven blood, has spent her entire life as an outcast in Amsara Castle. Her mother, the sister of the Duke of Amsara, died giving birth to her, leaving Jelena to be raised by her foster mother Claudia in the servants' hall, denied her proper place in the family by her uncle. Though her life is hard, Jelena has managed to adapt to her circumstances. Her fragile peace is shattered when she discovers she has a mysterious and frightening new ability that manifests itself as a powerful blast of blue energy. Convinced the energy is a form of magic inherent in her elven blood, Jelena desperately wants to learn the nature of her ability, and how to control it. She knows the only people who can teach her about elven magic are the elves themselves.

When the Duke announces his intention of selling her as a concubine, Jelena decides to flee Amsara forever. Claudia gives Jelena an extraordinary gift – a clue to her elven father's identity in the form of a signet ring. As Jelena's mother lay dying, she had given the ring to Claudia, charging her with keeping it safe and seeing that her daughter received the ring when she was old enough to understand its meaning.

With the ring as her only link to her unknown father, Jelena sets off north, her cousin Magnes by her side. The two cousins make it to the border, but are ambushed by bandits near the bank of a river. Just as the bandits are closing in for the kill, a mounted elven patrol sweeps down upon them. The leader of the elven patrol is Ashinji Sakehera, a young man unhappily constrained by the dictates of a society as tradition-bound and hierarchical as its Soldaran counterpart. Ashinji has been troubled by a dream, one in which a half-elven girl cries out to him for help, only to be swallowed up by a mysterious force of unspeakable menace. He has no idea what the dream means, but he will soon find out its significance as he rushes headlong into a stunning confrontation at the river's edge.

Meanwhile, an ancient entity, imprisoned and unconscious for a millennium, has at long last awakened. Implacably evil, its lust for revenge upon those who stripped it of power and exiled it to the eternal dark is second only to its desire to reclaim the key to its lost magic, a magic that will allow it to escape its prison and destroy, then remake, the material world to suit its own purpose. The entity with no name knows the magical key resides within a vessel, a living being that carries the energy in the form of a blue fire...

Griffin's Daughter is the story of a young woman's struggle to find her place in the world, a young man's search for his life's purpose, and the strength of true love." />
