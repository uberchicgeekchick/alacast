The world of White Trash Land.</p><p>After inheriting a trailer park, Chuck’s normally staid life is suddenly filled with an ex-wrestler lawyer, an obsessed Reverend who covets the land the trailer park sits on, a band of Promised Ones who set out to appropriate the park by any means necessary, a corrupt mayor, an old alcoholic and two pretty lesbians who are not exactly as they seem, and a blue haired punk film student who can create miracle inventions out of trash. Not to mention a motorcycle gang, and the mother of a rap wunderkind.</p><p>Stir in a bit of conspiracy, a bit of slapstick and a whole lot of Japanese Actuaries, and you have White Trash Land, written by Andrew Beatty and performed by Sean McGaughey.
