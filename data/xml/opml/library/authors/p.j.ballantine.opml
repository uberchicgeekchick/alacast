Ballantine &ndash; Where the Future &amp; Fey Collide]]>" description="<![CDATA[<h1>Digital Magic is the sequel to Chasing the Bard- the award winning podcast novel–written by New Zealand author Philippa Ballantine.</h1><p>Penherem is a quaint, sleepy English village where people go to escape the 21st Century. Hiding from the world of laptop computers, the Internet, and wireless communication, is Ella. A writer, now barren of ideas and drive, she resigns herself to a quiet life of solitude. Everything changes with the arrival of a shapeshifting thief. Suddenly, everyone begins to change–from the local librarian to the lady of the manor–revealing their true natures and dangerous secrets. Something in this sleepy English village is awakening… something that might be better left alone.</p>]]>"/>

And when the Lord of Crisfell betrays it is done on a grand scale. Ashi&#039;mei Candre feels her life is destroyed in that instant, but her love&#039;s betrayal goes far further- he is sacrificing his own people. Amongst the islands of Crisfell, honour and clan is everything, but that may also be their undoing. A dark secret from the past will now come back with a vengeance, and Ashi&#039;mei must put her own troubles aside to face this greater danger. For over the dark sea is a menace of flesh and hunger, which having been turned back once, is only more determined to remake Crisfell in its image. When the danger comes from within as well as without, Ashi&#039;mei&#039;s world is doomed. And yet there are two from beyond the island who may help, one a passionate young man from their traditional enemy, and the other a compelling creature with mastery of the flesh to rival the menace beyond the sea. With friends and clan her only hope, the time to stand and fight has come. Ashi&#039;mei must search within herself for salvation for her people, face her darkest fears, and risk everything she loves.]]>"/>
