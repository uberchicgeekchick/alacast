Luoma&#apos;s poems and lyrics range from idylls on Vermont (&quot;The Monkton Road&quot;) to songs the Boss might like (&quot;Cars &amp; Girls #342&quot;)to spell-like ritual poetry (&quot;Ceremonies of Light and Dark&quot;), and all points in between. The poems and spells are recited, the lyrics are sung accompanied by a guitar, recorded straight to two-track with some overdubs. The content is presented in a different order from the print book so that songs and poems could be mixed together. Special guest Sean Kelly of the Samples helped record &quot;Sonny&apos;s Got A Gun&quot; and plays on the podcast.]]>"/>
