The handsome rogue is a con-artist, but who is he conning?&nbsp; And even the wizard has a few surprises in store.&nbsp; While seeking the answer to all her problems, Miss the Merciless discovers that what she&apos;s always wanted may not actually be what she *wants*. *Nina Kimberly the Merciless* is a comic coming of age story filled with magic, mayhem and mercenaries, but mercy?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; This is a remastered version of the novel, with an all-new higher quality recording.&nbsp; The classic version of Nina Kimberly the Merciless is also available.&nbsp; Nina Kimberly the Merciless is now in print, available for purchase at Amazon.com</p>]]>" />
