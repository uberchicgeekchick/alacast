G.</h1>Britain won the Moon Race!&nbsp; Decades before Neal Armstrong took his &quot;giant leap for mankind&quot; two intrepid adventurers from Lympne, England, journeyed there using not a rocket, but an antigravity coating.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Bedford, who narrates the tale, tells of how he fell in with eccentric inventor Mr.&nbsp; Cavor, grew to believe in his researches, helped him build a sphere for traveling in space, and then partnered with him in an expedition to the Moon.&nbsp; What they found was fantastic!&nbsp; There was not only air and water, but the Moon was honeycombed with caverns and tunnels in which lived an advanced civilization of insect-like beings.&nbsp; While Bedford is frightened by them and bolts home, Cavor stays and is treated with great respect.&nbsp; So why didn&apos;t Armstrong and later astronauts find the evidence of all this?&nbsp; Well, according to broadcasts by Cavor over the newly-discovered radio technology, he told the Selenites too much about mankind, and apparently, they removed the welcome mat!
