Horror fiction. Dark fiction. Whatever you choose to call it, that is what is contained within this collection of short stories. But other than that, these tales are as varied as can be. Ghost stories... they&apos;re in there. Lovecraftian monsters... certainly. Twist endings... got it. Psychological terror... of course. Sunny, happy endings... not so much. Oh, and one other thing these stories have in common: they are intended for a mature audience- one who is not easily offended, I might add.</p>]]>" />
