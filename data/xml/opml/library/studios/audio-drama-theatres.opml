Prometheus Radio Theatre, a group of experienced Baltimore-area Fan actors, writers and directors, is embarking on what we like to think is a bold, new path (then again, maybe we&apos;re just deranged!)  We&apos;re bringing original, SF radio dramas to Fan audiences at area conventions, and we plan to offer said dramas via CD and streaming audio in the near future.  Our current project is an episodic series, The Arbiter Chronicles, which author Steve Wilson describes as &quot;a sort of Hornblower the Vampire Slayer in Space.&quot;  &quot;Arbiters&quot; tells the tale of young midshipmen (and women) in a future Navy, when the human race has expanded off earth, and things ain&apos;t as bright and cheerful as some might expect.]]>"/>
