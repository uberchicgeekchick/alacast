Difficult classes, weird teachers, food fights...girls.  Except Monson Grey is not Monson Grey.  At least, when he looks at himself in the mirror, the scarred face staring back is not someone he recognizes.  Now he finds himself attending an extraordinary school, the recipient of an incredible scholarship, among ridiculously rich classmates, and with no memory of how he got there or what to expect.  As bizarre events start to unfold around him, Monson wonders what secrets lay locked in his hidden past.  Add all this to a mysterious silver stone, an Indiana-Jones-copycat professor, Merlin the wizard, and even Atlantis, and you&#039;ll find yourself in a fantastic tale in which magic does exist and everything is never as it seems.</div></p>]]>"/>
