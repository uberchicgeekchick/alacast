Suddenly, the stoic and unruffled Wayne Hayter has some serious competition to contend with almost before his flirtation with Ceil manages to get off the ground. But Mason Phillips---with his cheerful positive outlook, pit bull-like tenacity and an unwillingness to hear the word 'no'--- has a couple of tricks up his sleeve to keep the ball in his court.
