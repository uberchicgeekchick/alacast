Tracing one man in a population of millions is easy—compared to finding one gang hiding out on one of billions of probability lines!</p><p>This story from 1955 has rocket ships, time travel, slaves, post-hypnotic suggestions, drugged citizens, and a complete disregard for human rights. And those are the good guys. As a look back in time at &quot;classic&quot; science fiction, it's an interesting snapshot of a time when tobacco was common, sexism was unconscious, and female characters were a long way from Lara Croft.</p><center>Narrated by Nathan Lowell.</center>]]>"/>

The golden age of space travel and asteroid mining has ended almost before it began and the bean counters have taken over.  Sally Buds&apos; patients are all suffering from low-gravity syndrome because the Canadian Mining Consortium won&apos;t spring for gravity generators and the miners won&apos;t exercise.  On top of this the station might be facing hard times.  An expensive mining robot disappeared while surveying a region of space known and KEL-30 or &quot;Kelthy.&quot;  The problem was not in replacing the robot, but rather in the fact that the machine reappeared after the replacement had been ordered.  How could the station personnel have been so incompetent?  But Sally has another question.  Where did the probe go when it was out of contact?  Where did the strange rock samples come from and why did the images it saw not correspond with known star charts?  Her new friend Ian Merryfield, an RAF shuttle pilot, wants to know, too.  But the station commander does not.  What is in the Kelthy region and why do things disappear there?  Is it a hoax intended to scare away claim jumpers or is it the greatest discovery of the twenty-first century?  Ian and Sally intend to find out even if it means risking their careers or even their lives.  Not knowing would be worse.]]>" />
