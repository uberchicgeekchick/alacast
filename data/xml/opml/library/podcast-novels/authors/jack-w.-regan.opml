Regan</h3><p>Young Max Ransome watched his father die, killed by marauding phantors as they swept through T&apos;Aragam at the bidding of the evil wizard Zadok.&nbsp; Barely escaping with his own life, Max is thrust into a whirlwind journey as he races against time to save T&apos;Aragam, the world he loves, from a dark dominion.&nbsp; Can Max overcome the horror of his father&apos;s death and save T&apos;Aragam from the grasping talons of its enemies?&nbsp; Woven with a charming mix of zany humor and genuine danger, &quot;T&apos;Aragam&quot; immerses the reader in a world of original characters and tightly-woven plot.&nbsp; Young Max leads the cast and is ably supported by, among others, a faithful medgekin friend named Gramkin, two monster brothers named Doom and Gloom, and an equuraptor named Dresden.&nbsp; Coupled with quirky supporting characters, such as mercenary Captain Baggywrinkle, Lord Stench, and a perpetually hungry sea serpent named Bob, this cast of characters steps from the pages and pulls the reader into the story.</p>]]>" />
