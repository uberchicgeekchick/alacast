Dunkin, the vampire slayer blends all this discordance and more into a hilarious adventure that moves from the muggy heat of Florida to the muggier heat of the Amazon. ....If Carl Hiaasson, Tim Dorsey and Dave Barry collaborated on a vampire story, it may have turned out like this absurd romp....]]>"/>

This could be bad news for humanity, but Devlin doesn't care as long as it doesn't interfere with his drinking. When innocents get hurt, he battles a giant hegdeapple, and singlehandedly attempts to cure the lust problem in the middle east.</p>]]>"/>

Is this more nonsense? Uh, no... yeah... maybe. Heh!  If you are looking for Dunkin, or Devlin, or Gabe-this is not it. This book borders on serious. I think I was out of liquor when I wrote it-but I can&apos;t remember.&nbsp; When you own a media outlet, you have a responsibility.

But in this book, &quot;Hard Boiled Headline&quot;, a gang of unusual newspaper hacks accept a large cash payment to start a newspaper during election season. There&apos;s only one string attached to the cash-use the paper to unseat an entire county&apos;s crooked officials.]]>"/>
