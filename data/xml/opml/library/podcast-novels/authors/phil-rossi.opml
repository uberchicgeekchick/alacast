Her branches reach for the stars.  She is like all other trees on planet Earth save for her enormous size. Still, she has leaves and she has bark. She turns sunlight into life. But this tree does not sprout from the dirt. Eden fills the sky, high in orbit above the blue expanse of Uranus.  There she changes humanity&apos;s very concept of extraterrestrial life. Dr. Malcolm Green is sent to Eden to audit a science team studying this extraordinary tree from the dark confines of space station Lola. But with unexplainable accidents plaguing the team, tensions are mounting between scientists and custodial staff. Is there a future for this project and Lola?  Only Malcolm Green can make that call. From the second he sets foot on Lola, Malcolm&apos;s own future becomes at stake.  He soon finds that love, friendship, and his own mortality tremble like a leaf at the sound of Eden&apos;s call. Eden is the latest podcast fiction offering from Phil Rossi, author of Crescent and Notes from the Vault.  ]]>" />

It&apos;s a wicked blend of the claustrophobia seen in Ridley Scott&apos;s Alien, and the viral demonology of Carpenter&apos;s Prince Of Darkness with the hard-drinkin&apos; bad attitude of Battlestar Galactica added for good measure. The future has never been so frightening. Phil Rossi brings it. --J.C. Hutchins, author of Personal Effects: Dark Art and 7th Son: DescentPhil Rossi has crafted a space station tale with sex, horror, and vibrant attention to tech and human detail. Evocatively served, highly recommended. ---Paul Levinson, author of The Plot to Save SocratesDarkness has inspired fear since mankind first watched the sun go down. Bad things hide in the dark feral beasts with mouths full of razors waiting for a taste of flesh. But now, the darkness is stirring with a life of its own. Crescent Station is the last bastion of civilization, floating in the cold, outer systems where colonized space gives way to the sparser settlements of the Frontier. Like the boom towns of distant Earth s Old American West, Crescent Station is a gateway to power, wealth, and opportunity for anyone who isn t afraid to get his or her hands dirty. But deep within the station s bowels, in Crescent s darkest and most secret places, an ancient evil is awakening and hungry, and it threatens the very fabric of space and time. Will the residents of Crescent Station find a way to stop it before the terror drives them insane? Or is it already too late?This is the original Podiobook as released in 2007.]]>" />
