So lets start with this... NSP is dedicated to producing original audio drama podcasts. But don&apos;t let the word podcast fool you. Our shows will be available for download, listening to on the internet, and of course if you want to subscribe to our podcasts as well.</p><p>We&apos;ve been asked many times...&quot;Why use the word necropolis for your name? Doesn&apos;t it mean something dead?&quot; No not exactly, it comes from the Greek nekcropolis which translates to &quot;city of the dead&quot;. A word used to describe a very large cemetery that might have been elaborate and ancient. Death being the end... A final resting place for our earthly bodies. Kind of morbid some might say, but consider this...</p><p>&quot;In the recess of your mind lies a dark corner in search of the unknown. &apos;What if?&apos; is the question and your imagination the driving force for the answer. A battle between good and evil? The fight between life and death. The yearning to know what might and could happen. &apos;What If?&apos;&quot;</p><p>-= The Gatekeeper =-</p><p>That is the driving force behind Necropolis Studio Productions. Those things that might bring us to that final resting place. As the human thirst for knowledge collides with the sprint to develop new technologies and sciences. &quot;What If?&quot;</p>]]>"/>

No one seemed safe at the time from the con-artists, thieves, robbers, prostitutes, the civil unrest , and of course then came the murders. There were quite a few more than was accounted for and it was unfortunate that so many met their fate at his hands. Whether they were good people or not... they surely didn&#39;t deserve to die in that manner. Everyone thought they knew who he was, but the sad fact of the matter... if they did, they couldn&#39;t prove it. Whitechapel was never the same again.]]>" />
