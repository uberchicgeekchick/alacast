However, he is not sure unless he can test out his ideas. John is lucky enough to come across a wealthy man who puts up the money to try out John's idea. But the crux of this book is, if he succeeds in getting there, wherever there actually is, what will he find when he gets there? Will he create situations that affect his own existence in the future? Would he be able to get back to his own world, universe or time? Or would John be trapped forever in that place and time that he so desperately wanted to travel to?]]>"/>
