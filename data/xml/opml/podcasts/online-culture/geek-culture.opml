The Dragon Page was my first audio experience and they introduced me to podiobooks. I loved the way that Mark Jeffrey, Tee Morris and Scott Sigler produced their stories for people to hear, and that gave me the idea that maybe the old audio dramas were not quite dead yet. Then I met Mark Foreman the Brooklyn Bluesman and I heard what he did on his show and I was floored. There is a way to get music onto the show andÂ it was good music.</p><p>I took all of these interests audio dramas, music, funny commercials and parodies stuck it all in my head. And this is the result. Please enjoy it because I know I am lovin’ it.</p>]]>" />
