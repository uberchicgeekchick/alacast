Technology is pervasive in our society, but the understanding of tech has not kept up with the degree to which it has penetrated our daily lives. Often fraudulent business practices or sensational media stories take advantage of the inadequate understanding of technology by the general public. We examine what tech is realistic and when tech is being used deceptively. We aim to present the science of tech from the scientific perspective. We let you know what the scientists who are doing the research are thinking. Join us for a critical examination of technology in popular culture.]]>"/>
