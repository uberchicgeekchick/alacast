Hailed as "New York's hottest and hippest literary ticket" by the Wall Street Journal, The Moth has been producing sold-out storytelling shows for over ten years. Stories are told without notes to a live audience by a wide range of people. The best have been captured here. For more information about our programs, live events, and CD&apos;s for sale, go to www.themoth.org. The podcast is updated on Mondays.]]>"/>
