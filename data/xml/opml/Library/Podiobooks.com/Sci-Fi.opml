Tracing one man in a population of millions is easyâ€”compared to finding one gang hiding out on one of billions of probability lines!</p><p>This story from 1955 has rocket ships, time travel, slaves, post-hypnotic suggestions, drugged citizens, and a complete disregard for human rights. And those are the good guys. As a look back in time at &quot;classic&quot; science fiction, it's an interesting snapshot of a time when tobacco was common, sexism was unconscious, and female characters were a long way from Lara Croft.</p><center>Narrated by Nathan Lowell.</center>]]>"/>
