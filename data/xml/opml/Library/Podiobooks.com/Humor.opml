Their favorite pond is missing. They're being chased by truck driving zombies, dirty cops, UFOs and other ne'er-do-wells. Someone stole Chett's jacked up Scottsdale four-by-four. Zombies are traipsing around their trailer, and crazy Uncle Crank is trying to feed them zombie chicken for dinner.</p><p>Aided by a classic computer nerd, a crazy man wielding a frying pan, and a space babe who gets nekkid any time someone turns out the lights, follow Chett and Harry as they battle their way across the rural countryside and ultimately save the world.</p><p>Why is their pond missing, and why did the Dodge of Death spring from the muddy crater left in its center? Who is Bob and why is she so good with shotguns? Why are they being chased by two really skinny, pale, bald, goatee-clad wierdos? What is the dirty county sheriff hiding? And will Chett and Harry ever make it out alive?</p>]]>"/>

Dunkin, the vampire slayer blends all this discordance and more into a hilarious adventure that moves from the muggy heat of Florida to the muggier heat of the Amazon. ....If Carl Hiaasson, Tim Dorsey and Dave Barry collaborated on a vampire story, it may have turned out like this absurd romp....]]>"/>

It's a rip off of X-Files, featuring a near indestructible alcoholic vampire, with few socially redeeming qualities. His friends, including a wolf and a chimp are all smarter than he is, but he does excel at drinking and mayhem.</p><p>Here, he takes the case of a strange entity called the Hell hermit, who has lost the Key of Death. This could be bad news for humanity, but Devlin doesn't care as long as it doesn't interfere with his drinking. When innocents get hurt, he battles a giant hegdeapple, and singlehandedly attempts to cure the lust problem in the middle east.</p>]]>"/>

Is this more nonsense? Uh, no... yeah... maybe. Heh!  If you are looking for Dunkin, or Devlin, or Gabe-this is not it. This book borders on serious.
