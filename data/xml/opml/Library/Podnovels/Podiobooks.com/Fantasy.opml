She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she&#039;s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks...until something extraordinary happens.When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death-a cryptic message on Mac&#039;s cell phone-Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister&#039;s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed-a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae....As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister&#039;s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane-an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women-closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac&#039;s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book-because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands....]]>"/>
