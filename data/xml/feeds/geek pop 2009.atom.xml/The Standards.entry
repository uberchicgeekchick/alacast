<p style="text-align: left;">Science is just one of the many subjects that inspires this London-based indie band. Neil, Mark and Scott describe themselves as &#8220;all singing, all playing, all writing&#8221; and have been compared to some of the greats - Dylan (by the Metro), The Beach Boys (by Logo Magazine) and The Beatles (by us).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">11 Dimensions is the B-side for The Standards&#8217; forthcoming single, out in April. Neil says he was inspired to write the song after watching a TV programme about string theory.  <a title="The Standards online" href="http://www.myspace.com/thestandardsmusic" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> For more info, check out <a title="Let's Tea Party online" href="http://www.myspace.com/thestandardsmusic" target="_blank">The Standard&#8217;s myspace page</a>.</p>
