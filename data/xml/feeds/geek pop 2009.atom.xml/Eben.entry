<p>The name Eben is a contraction of the phrase &#8220;Extraterrestrial biological entity&#8221;, which goes a long way to explaining the influence that science has on their music. Drawing inspiration from unusual and as yet inexplicable areas of science, the band revel in what co-vocalist and guitarist Mike Peacock refers to as &#8220;quantum strangeness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mike shares vocal duties with brother Edd. They claim they are directed by a variety of rock, punk and indie from the sixties and later, but listeners might pick out Queens of the Stone Age, Oasis, The Doors, Pink Floyd and Nirvana as potential influences. Fresh out of the recording studio, Eben are ready to give Geek Pop &#8216;09 their all&#8230; Who knows where it might take them. <a title="Eben on myspace" href="http://www.myspace.com/ebensounds" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> Eben have a <a title="Eben on myspace" href="http://www.myspace.com/ebensounds" target="_blank">myspace page</a> - go check it out.
