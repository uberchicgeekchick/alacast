<p style="text-align: left;">Describing themselves as &#8220;like the surprise happy outcome of a deranged genetic experiment&#8221;, Radium88 can&#8217;t decide what genre they fit into - space-hop, neo-classical ambient techno-noir, weirdo-hip-trip-pop or retro-futurist&#8230; Hmmm.</p>
<p>Cornet player Mike Clifford is an engineering lecturer at the University of Nottingham, whilst writer and producer Tim Thwaites&#8217; background is in the chemical sciences. For the pair&#8217;s thoughts on Only Science Can Tell Us the Truth, billed somewhat cautiously as an album &#8220;anti-inspired&#8221; by science, listen to the Green Room interview.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Radium88 have played live all over the UK and toured in Spain, Holland and Belgium. They don&#8217;t play too many live gigs these days, owing partly to an undisclosed incident with a yak. Don&#8217;t ask, apparently. <a title="Radium88 online" href="http://www.radium88.net/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> But do check out their <a title="Radium88 online" href="http://www.radium88.net/" target="_blank">website</a> - and <a title="Radium88 shop" href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/radium885" target="_blank">buy their CDs</a>.</p>
