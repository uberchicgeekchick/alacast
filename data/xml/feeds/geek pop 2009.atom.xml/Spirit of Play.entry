<p style="text-align: left;">Spirit of Play mysteriously came into being in the middle of 2008, after a long period of idle talk and ineffectual body language. Like snowflakes, no two SOP songs are the same, and many are quite different even from themselves. The perceived members of the group are: Wendy Texas (electric 12-string and voice), Tom Woolfenden (drums), stephenmcaines (bass and voice) and Will Eaves (hair of the dog and voice). Their credentials are dubious.</p>

<p><em>Wave or Particle</em> is about everyone&#8217;s favourite bit of quantum mechanics: the idea that certain wee objects can have the properties of both waves and particles. Light, for example, has this kind of dual citizenship. So do frogs. People used to think electricity was a fluid. But we know better now, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Geek of the Week</em>, on the other hand, tells a sordid tale of research-lab geekery and true romance - of perverse egotism, hypocrisy, passion and microscopes. There is hardly any hard science in it, quite the opposite, in fact. It is rated &#8220;R&#8221; for &#8220;Ridiculous&#8221;. <a title="Spirit of Play online" href="http://www.myspace.com/spiritofplay" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> Make friends with SOP on myspace (<a title="Spirit of Play online" href="http://www.myspace.com/spiritofplay" target="_blank">their space</a>, actually).</p>
