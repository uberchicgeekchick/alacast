<p style="text-align: left;">Five years ago, Dave Crook, ceramic artist, triumphantly sporting a large, ungainly papier-mâché aeroplane head-piece and a freshly twanged guitar in his hand, declared himself Being 747. After joining forces with the Morricone brothers, 747 released two full length albums: Fun &amp; Games, and Health &amp; Safety.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Whilst flitting about between the musical genres of indie-pop, no-wave, alt-country, and garage rockabilly like some kind of rampant moth, they might also learn you some life lessons&#8230; Included in the back catalogue are ditties revealing the dangers associated with a future self-service NHS system (DIY Prescriptions), marrying a robot (Circuits &amp; Wires) and tackling the ocean waves without due care and attention (13 Stones To Float).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The band is currently working on a third, concept-style album, which will be a musical adaptation of David Attenborough&#8217;s groundbreaking natural history book/TV series Life On Earth. Various chapters of this have already crept into the band&#8217;s live set and they are currently touring schools as part of the &#8216;Amoeba to Zebra&#8217; project. The two songs featured here start with narrative introductions.  <a title="Being 747/Amoeba to Zebra" href="http://www.amoebatozebra.co.uk/being747.htm" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> Why not <a title="Being 747/Amoeba to Zebra" href="http://www.amoebatozebra.co.uk/being747.htm" target="_blank">hire them</a> to teach your kids a thing or two?</p>
