<p>Dr Stu is the alternate-universe rock-god alterego of Stuart Clark, science journalist with a PhD in astrophysics.   He is the author of The Sun Kings. Dan Breeze, who has spent many nights looking up at the stars when he failed to make it all the way home after a heavy one in the local, makes up the rest of the band. So actually, it&#8217;s just Dr Stu and the Neutron Star (singular).</p>
<p>Their song, also named <em>Neutron Stars</em>, showcases some awesome guitar skills and cracking science-based puns. Oh and a neat, musical description of a neutron star. Rock out. <a title="Stuart Clark online" href="http://www.stuartclark.com" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> You can find out more about Dr Stu, his books and music <a title="Stuart Clark online" href="http://www.stuartclark.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
