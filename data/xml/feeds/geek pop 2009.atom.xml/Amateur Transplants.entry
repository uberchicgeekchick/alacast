<p style="text-align: left;">Amateur Transplants are Adam Kay and Suman Biswas, two doctors with two jobs. That&#8217;s two jobs each, not in total&#8230; Essentially, they sing medicine related (and often shamefully dirty) songs to make money for charity. 10% of the proceeds from their first album were donated to Macmillan Cancer Relief.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The duo played Geek Pop in its first year of running and are back in &#8216;09 to entertain the crowds with tracks from their latest album, Unfit to Practise. Their encore song, as you&#8217;ve probably noticed, is based on Tom Lehrer&#8217;s chemistry classic, The Elements. <a href="http://www.amateurtransplants.net/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> Find out more at Amateur Transplants&#8217; <a href="http://www.amateurtransplants.net/" target="_blank">website</a>.
