<p style="text-align: left;">Dr Clandestino uses Fractmus 2000, an algorithmic-music generator, to create melodies using mathematical formulas. In the following passage he explains why and how he makes “fractal music”…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since the times of Ancient Greece, people realised that music and mathematics had a very close relationship, maybe because music is the most abstract form of art. Using mathematics explicitly to create music is nevertheless something of our time. Without the help of the modern computer it would be a daunting task (if not an impossible one) to do all the necessary calculations by hand. Think of it as a tool which gives you raw material that you can later use in your compositions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">FractMus uses only a few of the infinite possible random algorithms for note creation. Some of them exhibit fractal behavior, like the Morse-Thue sequence, Henon attractor, gingerbread-man fractal, etc, while others use well-known formulas.You can download it here.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I am working with FractMus and manipulating random algorithms, I inevitably come across something that intrigues me. When I hear something extraordinary in a fractal, the inherent feeling I get is that it’s not mine alone, it’s for the world and I must share it with them. There are some who think, “I made this great fractal. I rendered it and here it is: my fractal!” My opinion is that even at the completely rendered stage, the fractal is not owned. It’s the world’s fractal. The explorer just found it! Surely, a photographer does not claim, “I saw this great forest of trees on a mountain. I took a picture of it, and here it is: my forest of trees on my mountain!”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that I’ve expounded on this idea somewhat, you might understand the dilemma I have with fractal art. When does a fractal song fall under ownership? Is it the application of scripts chosen by the artist? Is it the moment a title has been slapped on it? At what point in the fractal exploration process can one call the fractal truly their own? This question has plagued me from the beginning. This is why I insist on altering a fractal song in some way to make it truly mine. Unless I have manipulated it in order to make it my own artistic statement, I do not feel right putting my name on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fractals have caused me to open my eyes to the “oneness” of the human race. A Mandelbrot fractal contains smaller generations of self-similar Mandelbrot patterns, but the entire lot is considered one entity, the Mandelbrot set. Isn’t it also true of humanity?  Will we, as a race continue forever in the infinite fractal loop? We could mutate, meld, learn and expand, continuing to form miniature near replicas of ourselves from generation to generation. In the end, though we are all unique in our individuality, we are all a part of the same entity: the human race. <em>Dr Clandestino</em></p>
