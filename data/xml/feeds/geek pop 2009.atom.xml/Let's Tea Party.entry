<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s Tea Party are a three piece band of Bristolian science graduates (is geography a science?). Having graced 08’s festival with a sci-poptastic <a title="Reptiles" href="http://geekpop.podbean.com/2008/02/25/lets-tea-party-reptiles/" target="_self">song about reptiles</a>, this year&#8217;s offering is a little less obviously geeky&#8230; But listen to the interview to find out the tragic story behind the song - inspired by a disappointing thesis performance by band member Sam. The thesis made reference to the German philosopher, Walter Benjamin, but the track tells of Sam’s relationship with his supervisor, and his misguided efforts to impress her and achieve high marks. Don’t be fooled by the tragic undertones, they’re a lot of fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In their own words: &#8220;Jonboy is a handclap timeless. Richard follows the strings. And Sam dances the shimmer. Together they are pop bounce.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rich, Sam and Jonboy are currently touring.  <a title="Let's Tea Party online" href="http://www.myspace.com/letsteaparty" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> To find out if they&#8217;re playing at a venue near you, go to <a title="Let's Tea Party online" href="http://www.myspace.com/letsteaparty" target="_blank">LTP&#8217;s lovely website</a>.</p>
