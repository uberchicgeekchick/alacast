<p style="text-align: left;">If ever a band was destined to perform at Geek Pop, it would undoubtedly be the Intercontinental Music Lab. Started by a group of friends in Cambridge, they&#8217;re a collective rather than a typical band, with the members of IML now based, as the name suggests, throughout many different countries and continents. IML collaborators submit a backing track to IML HQ (an underground stronghold based in a secret location, possibly the Moon) at which point it is randomly assigned to another contributor.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The group&#8217;s first album, Superheroes of Science, takes the stories of brilliant and often obscure scientists as its subject matter and brings them together in one charismatic and musically diverse offering. <em>Take Me Home to Orgonon</em> tells of psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich and the research centre where he lived and worked. Dr Robotnik (of Sonic the Hedgehog fame) was/is a slightly less credible scientist&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Although it might seem that Geek Pop is the only live performance IML could possibly give, they are in fact playing live on the 14th of March 2009 in Cambridge. If, <a title="Geek Pop crew in Cambridge" href="http://geekpop.podbean.com/2009/02/23/geek-pop-crew-in-cambridge/" target="_self">like the Geek Pop crew</a>, you are at a loss as to how this will be achieved without thousands of pounds worth of air travel, why not join us there? <a title="IML online" href="http://intercontinentalmusiclab.com/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> IML have a great website too.
