<p style="text-align: left;">Massachusetts&#8217; Professor Science is a musical fusion of brain and heart that has been edutaining listeners since January 2007. It began innocently and unintentionally when David Mansfield wrote a song about his favourite animal as a birthday present for a friend. The subject of the song, combined with the name, sparked another friend to believe that David was starting a band devoted solely to songs about science. While not his original intent, this seemed like a good idea anyway, and Professor Science was born. Currently, Professor Science consists of David and whoever happens to be around and good at an instrument.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Professor Science first performed <em>Sweet Home Apparatus </em>at <a title="Geek Pop '08" href="http://geekpop.podbean.com/category/music/" target="_self">Geek Pop &#8216;08</a>, but the addition of a video by bods at the Plant Endomembrane Research Group at Oxford Brookes University convinced Geek Pop organisers that it needed a second airing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">His other song,<em>The One About Rocks</em>, tells a story of love and&#8230; well&#8230; rocks. <a title="Professor Science online" href="http://professorsciencemusic.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt;</a> For more info or to get in touch with Professor Science, go to his <a title="Professor Science online" href="http://professorsciencemusic.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
