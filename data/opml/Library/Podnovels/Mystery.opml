Suppose al-Qaeda had a second, potentially more devastating attack planned in 2001. How would it be thwarted? &quot;The Onion Files&quot; is a spy thriller differing from all previous novels in one very important aspect: author Val Pattee was one of the Western world's top spy masters. Serving as chief of intelligence for NATO in Europe during periods of Cold War-era terrorism, he worked with the heads of intelligence for sixteen member nations, and conferred with his Soviet and Red Chinese counterparts.Although &quot;The Onion Files&quot; is fiction, Pattee infuses the action with a realism of people and places only an insider could deliver. The title refers to an ingenious and diabolical plot by al-Qaeda to devastate vast areas of the United States soon after the 9/11 attacks. Pattee introduces readers to protagonists Jim and Mark Buchan, who work with the US Central Intelligence Agency and Russian counter-terrorism units in a fast-paced hunt across three continents to halt a computer virus and its brilliant creator.]]>"/>
