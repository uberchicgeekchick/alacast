He made the mistake of saving a friend&#039;s life in violation of Medical Lobby rules. Now, he&#039;s a pariah, shunned by all, forbidden to touch another patient. But things are more loose on Mars. There, Doc Feldman is welcomed by the colonists, even as he&#039;s hunted by the authorities.

A cure to the plague is the price of peace, and only Feldman can find it.'/>
