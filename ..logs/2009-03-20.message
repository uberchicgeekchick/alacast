I've made 'src/Makefile' compatible with automake so if I need or choose I can rename it to Makefile.am & use it with auto-config.

I've done a lil work to improve my Alacast's init process.  But other wise I've just been to sick to be able to do any thing more creative.  So instead I worked a lil on two new features for Greet-Tweet-Know and a lot on working on several big changes for connectED.
